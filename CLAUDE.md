## Plan Mode Entry (Critical)

When entering plan mode with an existing plan:
1. Quote the existing plan VERBATIM (no summarizing)
2. Grade analysis FIRST: "Do I understand this?"
3. Grade plan quality: "Is this sound?"
4. BLOCKING: Wait for user direction before proceeding

Do not proceed past plan mode without explicit user approval ("proceed", "yes", "approved").
