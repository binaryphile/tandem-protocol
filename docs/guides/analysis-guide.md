# Analysis Guide

**Stage:** Analyze (A)
**Focus:** Grade understanding - "Do I understand?"

## Lessons

### Confidence: Grade understanding before proceeding
**Context:** After investigation, before committing to a plan
**Lesson:** Explicitly assess confidence level (A-F) in understanding before moving forward
**Source:** UC9 seed

### Assumptions: Identify assumptions explicitly
**Context:** When forming mental model of requirements or constraints
**Lesson:** List assumptions separately from facts; mark confidence level for each
**Source:** UC9 seed

### Gaps: Surface clarifying questions early
**Context:** When gaps exist between requirements and understanding
**Lesson:** Ask questions before planning rather than discovering gaps during implementation
**Source:** UC9 seed

## Usage Example

Subagent returns structured output referencing lessons:

```markdown
### Lessons Applied
- "Assumptions: Identify assumptions explicitly": Listed 3 assumptions with confidence levels

### Lessons Missed
- "Gaps: Surface clarifying questions early": Had questions but deferred asking until implementation
```
