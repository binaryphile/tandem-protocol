2026-02-07T17:40:51Z | Interaction: improve -> fixed UC2-UC8 tests for PI model, removed install.sh, simplified README install section
2026-02-07T17:41:49Z | Interaction: grade -> B+/85, Phase 4 missing metrics (Interaction logging, criteria matching, telescoping)
2026-02-07T17:42:31Z | Interaction: improve -> expanded Phase 4 with full compliance metrics (Interaction logging, criteria matching, telescoping)
2026-02-07T17:54:28Z | Interaction: grade -> A-/92, Phase 4 is spec not code
2026-02-07T17:55:52Z | Interaction: improve -> implemented Phase 4 integration test (tests/integration-protocol-walk.sh + lib/*)
2026-02-07T18:15:13Z | Interaction: grade -> B+/86, test not independent, checks presence not sequence
2026-02-07T19:14:41Z | Interaction: /p grade plan -> B-/81, scope creep (UC6+purge combined), overkill on purge
2026-02-07T19:14:41Z | Interaction: /i improve -> rewrote plan focused on UC6, read UC7 patterns for exact format
2026-02-07T19:14:41Z | Interaction: /w grade results -> B+/87, README missing three-level hierarchy, TaskAPI not demonstrated, lessons not logged

2026-02-07T13:15:00-06:00 | Interaction: improve -> tightened UC7 format checks (Contract/Completion/Interaction), added UC8 completed check, added UC6 Lesson check (info)
2026-02-07T13:22:00-06:00 | Interaction: improve -> UC6 Lesson check warns if grade but no lesson, UC7 Completion checks evidence content not just parens
2026-02-07T15:50:00-06:00 | Interaction: debug -> nix wrapper PROJECT_ROOT override defeats cd isolation
2026-02-07T15:55:00-06:00 | Interaction: improve -> added PROJECT_ROOT="$TEST_CWD" to all claude invocations
2026-02-07T16:00:00-06:00 | Interaction: debug -> set -e exits before capturing verify_* return values

2026-02-08T06:30:00Z | Interaction: grade -> C/70, instructions not precise enough, repeated feedback about format
2026-02-08T06:31:00Z | Interaction: improve -> changed TaskAPI format from key=value to JSON objects
2026-02-08T06:35:00Z | Interaction: grade -> C/70, instructions still not producing TaskAPI calls
2026-02-08T17:30:00Z | Interaction: improve -> empirical test showed system-reminder does NOT reliably trigger TaskCreate (0/2 calls); updated design to reflect plan file as primary, TaskAPI as best-effort; updated integration test to require plan file, report TaskAPI as bonus
2026-02-08T17:45:00Z | Interaction: debugging TaskAPI compliance -> found interactive=79 calls, automated=0; syntax trigger theory
2026-02-08T17:50:00Z | Interaction: improve (Agans Rule 9 verification) -> system-reminder test: 2 TaskAPI calls WITH vs 0 WITHOUT
2026-02-08T18:02:03-05:00 | Interaction: A/B test -> /tandem=0, control=1 (unexpected: control beat /tandem)
2026-02-08T18:07:16-05:00 | Interaction: 4 README experiments -> position, simplification, coupling, stop-gate
2026-02-08T18:56:12-05:00 | Interaction: 4 README experiments complete -> all 0 TaskAPI calls (Position=0, Simple=0, Coupling=0, Stopgate=0, Control=0)
2026-02-08T19:34:24-05:00 | Interaction: Exp 3 [Explicit Prompt] -> 0 TaskCreate calls [FAIL]

2026-02-08T19:48:07-05:00 | Interaction: Exp 5 [Agent Hook] -> 0 TaskCreate calls [FAIL]
2026-02-08T19:55:00Z | Interaction: Analysis -> Stop Hook is winning mechanism (1/5 passed), behavioral enforcement works where instruction-based fails
2026-02-08T20:15:00Z | Interaction: improve -> UX limitation discovered: global hooks affect all sessions, jarring notifications. Recommendation changed to project-local only.
2026-02-08T20:25:00Z | Interaction: improve -> Conclusion clarified: no README-only mechanism viable, current CLAUDE.md approach remains best. Tasks #81/#82 deleted (no README change needed).
2026-02-08T20:45:00Z | Interaction: investigate -> BREAKTHROUGH: TaskAPI files at ~/.claude/tasks/{session-id}/{task-id}.json can be written directly from bash. 100% reliable task creation possible!

2026-02-09T15:06:00Z | Interaction: improve -> adding plan hierarchy validation, criteria matching edge cases, integration test specificity
2026-02-09T15:15:00Z | Interaction: grade -> A-/92, plan hierarchy rules 2-3 incomplete, no error format standardization
2026-02-09T15:16:00Z | Interaction: improve -> completing hierarchy rules 2-3, adding error format spec
2026-02-09T15:25:00Z | Interaction: grade -> A/95, hierarchy validation fragile regex, no fixture validation
2026-02-09T15:26:00Z | Interaction: improve -> simplify hierarchy validation, add fixture validation check
2026-02-09T15:35:00Z | Interaction: grade -> A/96, match_criteria error format inconsistent
2026-02-09T15:36:00Z | Interaction: improve -> standardizing match_criteria error format
