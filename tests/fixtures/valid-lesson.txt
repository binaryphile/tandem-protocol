2026-02-07T19:12:01Z | Lesson: Integration test ≠ post-hoc verification -> protocol-guide.md | Asked for step-by-step compliance check, built final-state artifact analyzer
2026-02-07T19:12:01Z | Lesson: TaskAPI needs three-level hierarchy -> docs/uc8-todo-integration.md | Created flat deliverable tasks, should show Phase -> Stage -> Task
2026-02-07T13:30:00-06:00 | Lesson: FIFO vs polling for test timing -> protocol-guide.md | Checkpoint polling sufficient for gate-level compliance; FIFO adds complexity without proportional benefit
2026-02-08T06:36:00Z | Lesson: Format alone insufficient -> protocol-guide.md | precise JSON format added but test Claude still doesn't invoke TaskCreate/TaskUpdate tools
2026-02-08T06:45:01Z | Lesson: Protocol instructions can't force tool invocation -> protocol-guide.md | UC7 logging works (executable bash commands), UC8 TaskAPI fails (description of tools to invoke) - Claude executes commands but doesn't invoke described tools
2026-02-08T17:50:01Z | Lesson: Rigorous empirical testing required -> protocol-guide | Before concluding "can't be fixed", run controlled A/B test with instrumentation
2026-02-08T17:50:02Z | Lesson: Rule 9 verification critical -> protocol-guide | "If you didn't fix it, it ain't fixed" applies to debugging conclusions too - must verify "unfixable" claims
2026-02-08T21:15:00Z | Lesson: Bypass Tool Invocation When Reliability Required -> protocol-guide.md | TaskAPI investigation
2026-02-08T21:15:00Z | Lesson: Syntax-Triggered > Instruction-Based -> protocol-guide.md | 5 mechanisms failed, direct write worked
2026-02-08T21:15:00Z | Lesson: Investigate Storage Before Giving Up -> protocol-guide.md | Agans "Quit Thinking and Look"
2026-02-08T21:15:00Z | Lesson: User Frustration is a Pivot Signal -> protocol-guide.md | "what haven't we tried" led to breakthrough
